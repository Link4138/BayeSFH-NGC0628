# BayeSFH-NGC0628
Python code used to infer the star formation history of "**The stellar population responsible for a kiloparsec-size superbubble seen in the JWST 'phantom' images of NGC 628**"

## Requirements

The present repo was developed using the following python packages:

- &nbsp; python 3.11.3
- &nbsp; Numpy 1.24.3
- &nbsp; Scipy 1.10.1
- &nbsp; pystan 2.7.0  ([Installation](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html))

## Quick starting

If all the required packages are intalled in your computer, execute the .py script typing the following commad line: python bayestar_3mags.py

In case that all packages are working properly, the program will run sucessfully and write an ascii table with the following columns: Z, log_age, p10, p50, p90.

Plotting second and forth columns you will get the folowing figure
